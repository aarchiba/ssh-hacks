ssh-hacks
=========

ssh-hacks is a small collection of scripts to make it easier to work with 
complex SSH tunneling setups. The utilities it provides are:

tunnel: connect to a machine not visible to the one you're on through an 
        arbitrary sequence of intermediate machines. This is done using 
        port forwarding.

waitforagent: wait until a particular private key is stored in the SSH Agent,
              then exit cleanly. For use in startup scripts that should run
              as soon as the user enters their SSH passphrase.

ssh-hacks depends on the pure-python package paramiko, which depends on 
the compiled pycrypto.
